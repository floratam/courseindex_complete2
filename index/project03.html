        <h3> prompt </h3>

        <p> 
            this project asked us to design an infographic through self-observation and documentation as design-based research,
            especially with how we interact with digital tools and environments, for example, interfaces. it also requires that
            we record pieces of both quantitative and qualitative data and represent it in a space of our choosing.
        </p>

        <h3> concept </h3>
            
        <p>
            my idea was to observe the way i interact with spotify, something that is very integral to my daily routine and everyday
            life. i thought this would be an ideal interface to examine as it can provide many quantitative data points and qualitative,
            as music is very emotional and subjective. i sought out to thinking of what information i wanted to record and observe,
            as well as the best way to display this information afterwards.

            since i use my noise cancelling headphones often when i listen to music, i wanted to incorporate that element into the research.
            because the noise cancellation is often too strong for my liking, i like to have it on the "transparency" or ambient sound
            setting, allowing me to have bits of the noise around me in, along with whatever song i am listening to at that moment. because
            of this, i wanted to record both the "outisde" noise and "inside" noise, to show the contrast between the two environments.

        <h3> process </h3>

        <p>
            my initial idea was to have an interactive website that would revolve around a globe/sphere that would house all the content
            i would record and observe throughout my research, though this didn't pan out. there was definitely an attempt to code and add 
            all the content (audio, video, etc.) with code, though i found it quite a steep learning curve. this is the farthest i got with
            this initial exploration of coding in 3d space:

            since my first plan didn't quite work out, i opted for a medium i was a little more familiar with, which is video and motion design.
            this was a good compromise since i was more in my comfort zone, though not fully, and i was able to incorporate all aspects
            of what i wanted in my original concept (video, audio, image, text) - this was the best medium to display the data.
