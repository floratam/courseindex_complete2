        <h3>discussion 1: tool standards and poetics</h3>
        <p>
            1. In John-Patrick Hartnett's article about industry-standard design tools, he states his discontentment with the duopoly that Apple and Adobe have over the graphic design industry, as they have become "synonymous with with both the production of graphic design and the identity of the graphic designer." Meaning they are the very tools that shape the way of making for majority of students, professionals, freelancers, etc. in the industry, with little to no other competitors even coming close to the impact and reach that Adobe and Apple have with their software, technology and tools. He further writes about how designers have lost a sense of "ownership" over their own work - becoming more and more distant from the tools they use to create and simply just relying on what they are familiar with, or what's the "gold standard" in the industry. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In Gavin Mueller's article about the state of open-source tech, he also states that he believes open-source tech is vital to the industry, both when it was first emerging and even today - free, shareable code should be protected (such as with copyleft initiatives) from copyright, making it easily accessible to the masses. He also states that no matter what your intentions are at the start, eventually, these small startups that become successful, usually are bought out by much larger, well established companies later on, much like how GitHub was acquired by Microsoft. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Both articles have mostly negative outlooks on the current state of affairs - the centralization and commodification of the very basic, standard tools of making and sharing being monopolized by big, multimillion dollar companies has had largely negative impacts on the industry, especially those within it; software engineers, graphic designers, etc.
            <br>
            <br>
            Both articles do somewhat address solutions that are pertinent to each other, with the main message being to create more democracy and even just awareness and questioning of the very tools we consider standard or "tried and true." Hartnett doesn't provide much of a concrete solution, though draws readers to question: "What would it take for the technological foundations of the profession to become more heterogeneous and independent?" or even "[if] fundamental change even be possible at this point?" meanwhile Mueller believes that there needn't be a "decentralization" of tech, but changing the landscape towards a centrally organized, though more democratic tech sector instead. 
            <br>
            <br>
            2. I think besides technological mastery, or knowledge of tools and programs, having a good understanding of the sociopolitical and economic landscape is important as a designer. As design work is often emotionally or politically charged or influential, being aware of what's going on in the world is quite important as the work we make as designers should be well-informed and suitable for the message that we are trying to convey. Design can be a very powerful tool, so knowing exactly what must be said through the type, visuals, etc. and being able to communicate that accurately and clearly is crucial.

        <h3>discussion 2: olia lialina — turing complete user & laurel schwulst — my website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge...</h3>
        <p>
            2. Lialina defines the universal user as a "[user] who [has] the ability to achieve their goals regardless of the primary purpose of an application or device... [they] will find a way to their aspiration without an app or utility programmed specifically for it." I do believe this definition and "category" of users lends itself nicely to Schwulst's argument advocating for individual websites over platforms, specifically relating to the second part of the definition, which deals with not needing a specific app or platform designed for an action or goal. In this case, and in the case that Schwulst describes, it could relate to sharing work, writing about your day, etc. on a personal website, rather than on a social media platform such as Instagram or Twitter - severing the so-called "codependency" most "Users" these days have with the few mega-corporations that run the majority of the social media landscape. I think this category Lialina describes also shows that there are people out there that are trying to challenge their perception and relationship to the internet and how they interact with it, as at this point it is unavoidable. Although it may seem like we are trapped in this cycle we never signed up for, Liliana states, "there can be different examples and levels of autonomy that users can imagine for themselves, but the capacity to be universal is still in all of us."
            <br>
            <br>
            For almost my entire life, I have been a "User" - since the ripe age of 6 years old. I think a lot of people my age can relate as we've essentially, grown up with the internet, almost as if its a childhood friend that we've since moved in with and settled down with.  Unfortunately though, this has had some unhealthy consequences. It's almost as if the internet is a large house spider and I am a mere fly that's been caught in it's web for the past 14 years. Though I feel like I've done a good job at describing myself as someone who's viciously online, I still feel as though I don't have a great grasp of the ins and outs of the internet, sometimes I have unorthodox ways of documenting or accomplishing things, and this is perfectly summed up by this quote: "[They] will find a way to their aspiration without an app or utility programmed specifically for it. The Universal user is not a super user, not half a hacker."

        <h3>discussion 3: code, letters, logic, play</h3>
        <p>
            1. A pattern in nature that strikes me as being programmatic is the honeycomb of a bee hive. The inherent structure of it is a bunch of hexagons laid side by side, and there has never been a sighting of a honeycomb structure built from any other shape. This is the reason I believe it is programmatic in nature, as there have been no deviations from what we know as the "standard" honeycomb. As well, the same shape being repeated over and over again, suggests repetition and consistency which are all characteristics that are related to something being "programmatic" in nature. Supposedly, the reason for the use of the hexagon is due to the qualities of the shape - it is strong, yet it requires the least amount of material to fill an area compared to the only two other shapes that can stack and nestle into each other - the triangle and square. Furthermore, bees have to consume a lot of honey to make a fraction of the wax - consuming about eight times the amount of honey as the amount of wax produced! This makes sense as to why the bees would resort to this shape every single time, as it is the most efficient, making it the hexagon the ideal shape for the purpose that a honeycomb serves - storing honey.

        <h3>discussion 4: in free fall: hito steyerl</h3>
        <p>
            4. Due to the nature of aerial imagery and 3D-generated environments, most notably the method of generation - via machines, computers etc. Steyerl argues that this contributes to a society of "hyperreal representations" that can have benefits, but also dire consequences. I think one main issue that this can create is a sort of disorientation or false sense of reality. As much as we would like to believe the images captured are entirely accurate and true to what is actually there, there is no absolute guarantee that this is true. An image captured by a machine or a computer, could very possibly differ from how a human would experience it in real life. To add onto that idea, we are usually consuming these images through screens. Something like a 3D-generated environment that is viewed from a 2D plane, is not an accurate representation and is incomparable to actually experiencing it in person. Although technology gets very close these days, there are just certain factors like lighting, sound, smell, etc. that can't be fully replicated with these machines. All this can potentially contribute to the warping of reality - expecting something that we have gotten used to which is created by machine, but getting something different entirely when experienced in reality.
